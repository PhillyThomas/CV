                   <h4>Database & CRM Manager</h4>
                   <h4>Forum Events & Media Group Ltd</h4>
                   <p>
                        •	Lead and managed the CRM migration for ‘Forum Events Ltd’ in 2020, moving from ‘GoldVision’ to ‘Workbooks’. The project began in March 2020, and was officially rolled out in October 2020, within timeframe expectations. 
                        The project required full analysis of the existing database in order to clean the data ready for import. I created automation scripts using PHP to identify any records that could be ‘dirty data’. My years of experience using SQL (in particular, MySQL, MS SQL, and MariaDB) were invaluable during this project. 
                        I configured the new CRM based on feedback from brainstorming sessions with team management, creating processes that struck the perfect compromise between being simple for the end-user, but also capturing all required data.
                        <br>
                        •	Lead the Database & CRM Team at ‘Forum Events Ltd’. My responsibilities include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Managing the database (Cleaning, sourcing new data, optimisations, etc)</li>
                                <li>Managing the CRM. This includes creating bespoke reports for key stakeholders in the business, modifying the CRM to suit business requirements, creating and implementing user processes, and developing system automations using PHP scripts, liaising directly with the developers when required.</li>
                                <li>Creating high- and low-level reports for weekly stakeholder presentations. These include sales KPI reports, business performance reports, and analysis reports showing key points to focus on over the next quarter.</li>
                                <li>Working closely with the Marketing team to create tailored marketing lists based on campaign analysis results. </li>
                                <li>Working closely with the Sales team to give them the best chance possible at a successful sale. My latest automation project assigns records with a score (initially ‘0’) and raises or lowers it intelligently depending on how that person responded to marketing and sales calls in the past. Positive responses raise the score to a maximum of 100, negative responses lower it to a maximum of negative 100. The higher the score, the more likely that person is to respond positively to our sales team. </li>
                                <li>Managing the Database & CRM Team, delegating smaller responsibilities such as ad-hoc report requests, data cleaning tasks, and data entry tasks. </li>

                    <p>
                        At ‘Kaleidovision’ I was part of the technical support team, but quickly rose to an analytical role once I had proven myself to the CTO. I assisted in planning the CRM migration from a legacy in-house CRM, to MS Dynamics. 
                        <br>Other responsibilities include:
                             <ul>

                    <h4>PayPoint PLC</h4>
                    <p>
                        My duty was to assist various large retail companies, resolving any PPoS related issues they have whilst 
                        adhering to strict SLAs. I have supported a large-scale rollout which tripled PayPoint’s estate. I also streamlined 
                        many of their processes including daily and weekly reports, and creating automated spreadsheets which 
                        reduce the job times of many tasks including data entry and analysis.<br>
                        I also instigated all data analysis within the team, transforming how the team operated by creating in-depth 
                        reports on all issues received and team performance. Using those reports we could pinpoint weak areas, or 
                        areas of higher priority. This helped us achieve a much more streamlined helpdesk service, as well as find ways 
                        to reduce incident numbers in general. <br>
                        We were awarded the Team Award at our 2015 company award ceremony, helped largely through my 
                        contributions.

                        I was first line support for a new transaction service which replaced The Post Office’s gyro cheque system. I 
                        resolved issues under a strict SLA, whether it was customer service or technical. I streamlined many processes 
                        whilst on this team, creating calculators, dashboards and data analysis spreadsheets to make the job quicker 
                        and easier. Using my knowledge in excel I cut down the time taken to prepare the weekly report from 90 
                        minutes to 15 minutes.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have developed and maintained multiple private servers for the online MMORPG “Ragnarok Online”. Using a coding language derived from JavaScript to create custom content for our players, whilst also modifying the base game code in C++ and C#. 
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My most popular addition which has been downloaded over 100 times by other developers was an ‘NPC’ (<i>Non-playable character</i>) that scanned the player’s inventory, and would purchase items from the player in bulk. This saved players time and effort, as the base-game only offered a basic UI for merchant interaction. 
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My system would provide players with the option to limit which items would be sold by dictating a minimum rarity to sell by percentage (<i>For example, players could state they would only want items with a drop percentage of over 50% to sell, preventing rare items from being sold accidentally</i>). Players could also specifically add items to a ‘Blacklist’, which was stored in an SQL table joined to their account data.

                        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have created and currently maintain the website for my covers band ‘Total Recall’, which can be viewed by <a href="https://totalrecallcoversband.co.uk" target="_BLANK">clicking this link</a>.<br>As our budget was low, we opted to create as many tools as possible in-house to avoid costly subscriptions for various widgets. I ended up creating a simple captcha system, a document e-sign system, and a content management system to govern the 'gallery' section of the website.<br>Code is available upon request.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have created an online quiz game based on a popular YouTube channel called ‘Um Actually’. This project utilises PHP8 heavily. The website allows the ‘Quizmaster’ to select questions, which will then display on the player’s smartphones. The player UI website includes a button which acts as their buzzer, playing a sound that can be selected by the player from a list of pre-curated audio clips. Each buzzer stores the time it was pressed to the millisecond, allowing the Quizmaster to determine which player buzzed in first. I have plans to re-code the game and design the website to be more user-friendly. Once this is complete the website can be launched formally, with the intention of allowing anyone to create an account and invite their friends to play a game of ‘Um Actually’ live, no matter where they are in the world.
